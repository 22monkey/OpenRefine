Join the [discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openrefine) if you have any questions!

##Develop the Next Version
You have some developers skills and want to help fix current bug and develop the next release of OpenRefine. Log in on GitHub and fork [OpenRefine repository](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine). We accept pull request on a regular basis.

You'll find more information regarding OpenRefine architecture in the [Documentation for Developers](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Documentation-For-Developers) wiki section. 

From there you can help us to help us to fix open issue or propose new enhancement using the [Issue List](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues?state=open).
 
##Documentation and Support Users
Not a coder but still want to help? No worries you can help OpenRefine to grow in several ways:
* by [maintaining the documentation](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki), you will need a GitHub account ([create one for free](https://github.com/signup/free)). 
* helping user with questions on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openrefine)
* Alternatively if you are writting tutorial on your own platform, please give us a shout so we can add it to the [OpenRefine Custom Search Engine](/OpenRefine/documentation)

We will be soon releasing an issue list regarding the documentation to guide new participants.
