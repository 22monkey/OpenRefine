# OpenRefine Custom Search Engine

Currently OpenRefine documentation is scatter across multiple platforms (current wiki, help embedded in the interface, this blog and a myriad of other specific tutorials) making it hard to find the right information when one need it. So we designed this custom Google Search Engine to help you to find the piece of information you're looking for.
